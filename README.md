## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is one of my first Frontend Mentor challenges. I'm taking my first steps in studying web development, so pretty much everything is new to me.

### Continued development

Since I'm just starting to learn about web development, I'm trying to focus on the basics of HTML and CSS, while also introducing myself to topics like Flebox and Grid Layout, Mobile-first, naming conventions etc.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This source is helping me a lot in understanding the aspects of each element and attribute of HTML5 and CSS3.
